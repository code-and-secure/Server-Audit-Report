# TCMS API Client Documentation

## Overview
The TCMS API Client provides a way to interact with the TCMS system programmatically. This allows developers to automate tasks, retrieve data, and integrate TCMS with other applications.

## Authentication
To access the TCMS API, you must authenticate using an API key. The API key should be included in the headers of your requests as follows:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

## Endpoints
- **GET /api/v1/resource**: Retrieve a list of resources.
- **POST /api/v1/resource**: Create a new resource.
- **GET /api/v1/resource/{id}**: Retrieve a specific resource by ID.
- **PUT /api/v1/resource/{id}**: Update a specific resource by ID.
- **DELETE /api/v1/resource/{id}**: Delete a specific resource by ID.

## Error Handling
The API returns standard HTTP status codes to indicate the outcome of API requests. Common error responses include:
- **400 Bad Request**: The request was invalid.
- **401 Unauthorized**: Authentication failed.
- **404 Not Found**: The requested resource was not found.
- **500 Internal Server Error**: An unexpected error occurred.

## Integration Examples
### Example 1: Fetching Resources
```python
import requests

url = 'https://api.tcms.com/api/v1/resource'
headers = {'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'}
response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)

if response.status_code == 200:
    resources = response.json()
    print(resources)
```

### Example 2: Creating a Resource
```python
import requests

url = 'https://api.tcms.com/api/v1/resource'
headers = {'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY', 'Content-Type': 'application/json'}
data = {'name': 'New Resource'}

response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data)

if response.status_code == 201:
    print('Resource created successfully')
```

## Best Practices
- Always handle API errors gracefully in your applications.
- Use pagination for endpoints returning large datasets.
- Keep your API key secure and do not expose it in client-side code.
